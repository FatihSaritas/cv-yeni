    content: "Dear Sir/Madam, I am Fatih Sarıtaş. I graduated from Sports Management and Computer Programming departments. During my education, I developed a great interest in software development and started to improve myself as a Full Stack Developer. I mainly specialize in frontend technologies, along with intermediate-level backend knowledge. I am actively seeking job opportunities and aim to advance my career in software development, particularly in the IT sector. In the post-university period, I am looking for volunteer or internship opportunities to be part of a team, work on real projects, and learn new technologies. I have no financial expectations during this process; my priority is to learn, produce, and improve myself. I am confident and believe that when given the opportunity, I can prove myself by taking responsibility. With my development-oriented approach and high motivation, I think I can contribute to your team. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. If you find it appropriate, I would like to meet and talk with you in more detail. Best regards, Fatih Sarıtaş"
